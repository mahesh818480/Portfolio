           Hey there! I’m Rajesh — a UI Developer who loves turning ideas into clean, interactive, and visually appealing web experiences. With 3+ years of experience, I’ve spent my time crafting responsive layouts, building smooth user flows, and making the web just a little more delightful using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Angular.

I’m the kind of developer who enjoys both the creative side of design and the logical side of coding. Whether it’s polishing a UI detail, improving performance, or writing neat test cases with Jasmine, Jest, Karma, and end-to-end tools, I always aim for quality and clarity.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me learning something new, exploring UI trends, or experimenting with small side projects that help me grow as a developer.

If you're looking for someone who brings creativity, curiosity, and clean code to the table — I’d love to connect!
