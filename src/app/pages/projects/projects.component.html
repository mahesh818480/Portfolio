                        Developed a reusable Angular component library showcased in Storybook, aimed at standardizing UI
                        components across multiple projects. The library includes forms with validations, buttons,
                        modals, carousels, and accordions, ensuring a consistent user experience. Implemented unit and
                        integration tests for both HTML and TypeScript files to guarantee code reliability and
                        maintainability. Leveraged Angular best practices such as Reactive Forms, modular architecture,
                        and component-driven development.
